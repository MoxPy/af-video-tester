# AFVT - A command-line tool for written in Go for testing RTMP and HLS streaming. AFV utilizes VLC and networking techniques to check if a streaming source is functioning correctly

## Features

AFVT is a tool that uses a combination of networking techniques and VLC to check if a streaming source is functioning correctly. Hereâ€™s how it works:

    Server Check: It uses HTTP requests and a net.Dialer to verify if the streaming servers (RTMP or HLS) are reachable and operational.

    Stream Check: Once the server is confirmed to be up, it launches VLC to test if the streaming feed is actually working and playable. VLC is used to attempt to play the stream and verify its integrity and availability.

You can check an RTMP or HLS streaming source individually, or take advantage of Go's goroutines to open and test multiple streams concurrently using VLC by invoking the full-test command.

## Usage

### RTMP Test

This command tests a single RTMP stream.

```bash 
afvt rtmp --url rtmp://example.com:1935/streaming
```
    --url: URL of the RTMP stream to test.
    --vlc, -v: Path to the VLC executable. For example: /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC is the default value, you can omit it if you are on MacOS.

### HLS Test

This command tests a single HLS stream.

```bash 
afvt hls --url https://example.com/stream.m3u8 --duration 20
```
    --url: URL of the HLS stream to test.
    --duration: Duration of the test in seconds. Default is 20 seconds.
    --vlc: Path to the VLC executable. For example: /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC is the default value, you can omit it if you are on MacOS.

### Long RTMP Test

This command tests a single RTMP stream for 100s.

```bash 
afvt afvt long-rtmp --url rtmp://example.com:1935/streaming
```
    --url: URL of the RTMP stream to test.
    --vlc: Path to the VLC executable. For example: /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC is the default value, you can omit it if you are on MacOS.

### Full Test

This command tests both RTMP and HLS stream. It takes advantage of Go's goroutines to open and test multiple streams concurrently.

```bash 
afvt afvt long-rtmp --url rtmp://example.com:1935/streaming
```
    --rtmpurl: URL of the RTMP stream to test.
    --hlsurl: URL of the HLS stream to test.
    --duration: Duration of the HLS test in seconds. Default is 20 seconds.
    --vlc: Path to the VLC executable. For example: /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC is the default value, you can omit it if you are on MacOS.
